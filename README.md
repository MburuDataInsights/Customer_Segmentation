# K-Means Clustering and Customer Segmentation
This repository provides an overview and implementation of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data points into distinct groups based on their similarities. In the context of customer segmentation, K-Means clustering helps identify homogeneous groups of customers, allowing businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a critical task in marketing and customer relationship management. It involves dividing customers into groups based on their common characteristics, such as demographics, purchasing behavior, or preferences. By segmenting customers, businesses can personalize their marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.

K-Means clustering is a simple yet effective algorithm for customer segmentation. It operates by iteratively assigning data points to clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, effectively grouping similar data points together. The output of K-Means clustering is a set of clusters, each containing data points with similar attributes.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:


Install the necessary dependencies. You can use the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare your dataset. Ensure that your data is in a suitable format for clustering. If necessary, preprocess and transform the data to remove outliers, normalize features, or handle missing values.

Run the K-Means clustering algorithm on your dataset. The repository provides an example implementation that you can modify to fit your specific use case.

## Examples
This repository includes an example implementation of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. You can find the implementation in the examples directory. The example demonstrates how to load a dataset, apply K-Means clustering, and visualize the resulting clusters. Feel free to modify the example code to suit your needs.
